                <p>The Happy Isles Trailhead is located in the southeastern corner of Yosemite Valley, roughly a
                    mile
                    east
                    of Curry Village (Half Dome Village). Yosemite Valley shuttle stop 16 provides easy access. If
                    you
                    are
                    driving, a hikers parking lot is located just east of Curry Village (Half Dome Village), but
                    like
                    all
                    parking lots in Yosemite Valley, the spots get taken up very early in the day.</p><br>
                <p>From the Happy Isles Trailhead, follow the paved trail south as it begins its ascent up the
                    narrowing
                    gorge that surrounds the Merced River. At .9 miles is the first hikers' bridge; on the far side
                    is a
                    water fountain and bathrooms. Continuing up the gorge now on the right (south) side, the trail
                    gets
                    more
                    strenuous with many granite steps making their way up the steep slopes in front of Vernal Fall.
                    During
                    spring runoff, this part of the trail is thrilling as spray from the powerful fall makes
                    everything
                    wet
                    and slippery; there is a reason they call it the Mist Trail! (While you will typically remain
                    dry
                    during
                    the low-flow late summer and autumn months, be prepared to get wet during spring and early
                    summer.)
                    Just
                    past the spray zone, the steps get even steeper as the ingenious trail heads into an alcove
                    before
                    making its final ascent to the top of Vernal Fall.</p><br>
                <p>Above Vernal Fall, the trail continues along the banks of the river as the majestic Liberty Cap
                    and
                    Mount
                    Broderick peaks can now be seen in the distance. A second hiker's bridge crosses back over to
                    the
                    left
                    (north) side of the river as the trail wanders up through a lovely forested section. Then with
                    Nevada
                    Fall in view, the trail makes its final big push up several switchbacks that ascend the
                    boulderfield
                    under Liberty Cap. Just as you think your legs can't do it any more, the trail will top out. You
                    are
                    now
                    roughly 2000 feet above the floor of Yosemite Valley, but you still have 2800 feet more of
                    elevation
                    gain to get to the top of Half Dome!</p><br>
                <p>At the trail junction, turn left and head northeast towards Little Yosemite Valley. After a brief
                    section
                    of uphill just under Liberty Cap, the trail begins a leisurely descent into the lovely forested
                    valley.
                    Enjoy this section of trail as it is the only level hiking you will experience all day. At the
                    trail
                    junctions, follow the signs that point to Half Dome. (The backpackers' campground at Little
                    Yosemite
                    Valley is popular for those doing Half Dome as a two-day hike.)</p>
                <p>After roughly a mile in Little Yosemite Valley, it's time to work hard again as the trail heads
                    north
                    and
                    zigzags its way up the forested slopes, ascending roughly 1600 feet in two miles to reach the
                    top of
                    the
                    ridgeline. (Along the way, you will pass one last junction with the trail that continues up to
                    Clouds
                    Rest.) This section may seem unrelenting, but keep a slow and steady pace and allow for plenty
                    of
                    short
                    breaks if you are out of breath from the elevation. Once you are heading east on the ridgeline,
                    the
                    forest will thin out a bit and you will see great teaser views down into Tenaya Canyon to the
                    right
                    (north). Soon enough, you will see your final destination straight ahead: Half Dome with the
                    round
                    "Subdome" in front of it.</p><br>
                <p>The Subdome is the rounded shoulder formation of bare granite to the east of Half Dome proper,
                    and as
                    you
                    approach it, it will look intimidating and improbable, but once you're on it, it will seem quite
                    reasonable. The ingenious trail is
                    akin to
                    a giant staircase, zigzagging its way up the cracks and features of the steep and exposed
                    formation.
                    This section is strenuous but it relents soon enough and then you will be facing the final
                    obstacle:
                    the
                    cable route up the bare east ridge of Half Dome! Stow your hiking poles and put on your gloves
                    for
                    the
                    most thrilling and terrifying section of trail in Yosemite.</p><br>
